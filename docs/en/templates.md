        The purpose of ODON is to promote the use, provision, and publication of open data. We do this by providing APIs serving data sets that are open.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span><b>Registration</b>: 
          Since we operate these APIs within our financial means and want to prevent misuse, a simple registration is required. After registration, you will receive a URL token that allows you to use each of our APIs for a set number of requests without further restrictions. Please send an email to info@odon.at to do this.</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span><b>More Requests</b>:
          Should you require more requests, you can register as an associate member to receive a higher request quota.</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span><b>Missing data sets</b>:
          We are always open to suggestions and requests for new APIs; please send us an email to info@odon.at.</span>
