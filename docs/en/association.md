            <p>ODON is a Vienna-based association registered in Austria (ZVR: 1593372349). The association is dedicated to the technical processing and effective use of Open Data. Our mission is to make data accessible and usable for the public in order to foster innovation, transparency, and knowledge sharing across society. We believe that Open Data is a valuable public resource which, when used effectively, can inspire new ideas, strengthen trust in public institutions and processes, and contribute to the collective expansion of knowledge.
