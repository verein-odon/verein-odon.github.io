Our association offers technical solutions that help companies, organizations, and institutes manage Open Data efficiently. We distinguish between standard solutions and individual solutions to meet a wide range of requirements.

# Standard Solutions

Our standard solutions are ideal for organizations looking to publish Open Data for the first time. They provide a cost-effective and straightforward way to enter the world of Open Data. These solutions include:

- **Data Storage and Provision**: Providing platforms for the publication of Open Data.
- **APIs for Data Access**: Standardized interfaces for easy integration and data use.
- **Documentation and Training**: Accompanying materials and guidance to make handling the data easier.

The costs for our standard solutions are only slightly above the necessary infrastructure costs (such as servers, networking, and maintenance). They thus represent an affordable and reliable baseline solution.

# Individual Solutions

For specific requirements, we develop tailor-made technical solutions. These are aligned with the unique needs of your company or institution and can include the following services, among others:

- **Data Adaptation and Optimization**: Adjusting data formats for specific applications.
- **Advanced API Features**: Developing custom interfaces for complex use cases.
- **Integration and Automation**: Seamlessly incorporating Open Data into existing systems and processes.
- **Consulting and Innovation Support**: Assisting in the planning and implementation of innovative projects based on Open Data.

Individual solutions make it possible to leverage the full potential of Open Data and achieve targeted benefits for your organization.
