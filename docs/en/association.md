            <p>Our mission is to create a platform that enables everyone to access open data and use it for their own projects, research, or business purposes. By providing technical infrastructure and user-friendly interfaces, we aim to lower the barriers to using open data and promote collaboration among users, developers, and organizations.

Our team combines technical know-how with a deep understanding of the societal significance of open data. Together, we work to ensure that open data can become the foundation for new ideas and projects. For questions or collaboration with our association, you can contact us at any time.
