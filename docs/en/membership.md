# Become a Member of ODON – Together, We Shape the Future!

Our association does everything in its power to fulfill its purpose in the best possible way. We know that this would not be possible without our members. A diverse membership base is essential to us for bringing together different perspectives and expertise. Therefore, we offer various membership types tailored to different needs and interests.

## Full Membership (Ordentliche Mitgliedschaft)

As a full member, you are actively involved in the association's activities and help decide the direction in which ODON develops. You contribute your skills to fulfill the association's purpose and move the organization forward.

If you want to get involved with Open Data and help us make the world a better place, then become a full member! Send us an email at [info@odon.at](mailto:info@odon.at) with a brief description of yourself and your reasons for joining ODON as a full member.


## Associate Membership (Außerordentliche Mitgliedschaft)

Would you simply like to use ODON's services—such as our APIs, training sessions, or other materials—without being actively involved in the association's internal operations? Then an associate membership is exactly right for you.



Whichever membership you choose — your support is a vital contribution to promoting our common goal!
