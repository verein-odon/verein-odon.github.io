ODON invites individuals and organisations interested in Open Data to become members of the association. Membership helps sustain the development of services and infrastructure while strengthening a growing community around open and reusable data.

Members support ODON’s non profit mission and contribute to a shared effort to improve how Open Data is used across sectors.
