        Your Support, Our Infrastructure
    </h2>
    <p>
        Open Data is a powerful resource, but it only creates value when it is accessible, reliable, and easy to use. At ODON, we bridge the gap between raw data and real-world application by providing the essential technical infrastructure and user-friendly APIs that developers and researchers need. As a non-profit association, your support directly funds the servers, maintenance, and development required to keep these resources free and accessible to the public.
