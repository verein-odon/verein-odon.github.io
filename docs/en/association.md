# About

ODON is registered in Austria as an association (ZVR: 1593372349) and is based in Vienna.

Our association is dedicated to the technical processing and use of Open Data. Our goal is to make data accessible and usable for the public to foster innovation, transparency, and knowledge dissemination in our community. We believe that Open Data is a valuable resource. This resource, when utilized effectively, can stimulate new ideas, strengthen trust in public processes, and expand knowledge within society.

## Our Mission


Our mission is to create a platform that enables everyone to access open data and use it for their own projects, research, or business purposes. By **providing technical infrastructure** and **user-friendly interfaces**, we aim to lower the barriers to using open data and promote collaboration among users, developers, and organizations.

Our team combines technical know-how with a deep understanding of the societal significance of open data. Together, we work to ensure that open data can become the foundation for new ideas and projects. For questions or collaboration with our association, you can contact us at any time.
