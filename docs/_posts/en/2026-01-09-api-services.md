ODON continues to improve access to Open Data by expanding its API based services. The focus remains on making high quality public datasets easier to discover, access, and integrate into applications, research projects, and educational use cases.

The ongoing development reflects ODON’s commitment to lowering technical barriers and supporting developers and organisations that rely on Open Data for innovation and transparency. In the next days, we will update the API logic to make the API more performant. It is not expected that users will notice any interruption.
