    loans with an original grant element of 35 percent or more. The grant element
    of a loan is the grant equivalent expressed as a percentage of the amount committed.
    It is used as a measure of the overall cost of borrowing. The grant equivalent
    of a loan is its commitment (present) value, less the discounted present value
    of its contractual debt service; conventionally, future service payments are discounted
    at 5 percent. Data are in current U.S. dollars.

- description: Droughts, floods and extreme temperatures is the annual average percentage
    of the population that is affected by natural disasters classified as either droughts,
    floods, or extreme temperature events. A drought is an extended period of time
    characterized by a deficiency in a region's water supply that is the result of
    constantly below average precipitation. A drought can lead to losses to agriculture,
    affect inland navigation and hydropower plants, and cause a lack of drinking water
    and famine. A flood is a significant rise of water level in a stream, lake, reservoir
    or coastal region. Extreme temperature events are either cold waves or heat waves.
    A cold wave can be both a prolonged period of excessively cold weather and the
    sudden invasion of very cold air over a large area. Along with frost it can cause
    damage to agriculture, infrastructure, and property. A heat wave is a prolonged
    period of excessively hot and sometimes also humid weather relative to normal
    climate patterns of a certain region. Population affected is the number of people
    injured, left homeless or requiring immediate assistance during a period of emergency
    resulting from a natural disaster; it can also include displaced or evacuated
    people. Average percentage of population affected is calculated by dividing the
    sum of total affected for the period stated by the sum of the annual population
    figures for the period stated.

    strength of deposit takers by comparing Tier 1 capital to total assets. Tier 1
    capital, often referred to as core capital, includes the most stable and readily
    available forms of capital, such as common equity, disclosed reserves, retained
    earnings, and certain other instruments that meet regulatory requirements under
    the Basel framework. This capital is considered the highest quality because it
    is fully available to cover losses and does not need to be repaid.

- description: The HCI lower bound reflects uncertainty in the measurement of the
    components and the overall index. It is obtained by recalculating the HCI using
    estimates of the lower bounds of each of the components of the HCI. The range
    between the upper and lower bound is the uncertainty interval. While the uncertainty
    intervals constructed here do not have a rigorous statistical interpretation,
    a rule of thumb is that if for two countries they overlap substantially, the differences
    between their HCI values are not likely to be practically meaningful.

- description: B-READY focuses on ten topics that are organized following the life
    cycle of the firm and its participation in the market while opening, operating
    (or expanding), and closing (or reorganizing) a business. The Market Competition
    topic measures good practices related to the enforcement of competition policy,
    intellectual property rights and innovation policy, and regulations that focus
    on improving competition and innovation in markets where the government is a purchaser
    of services or goods, across the three different pillars. The second pillar measures
    the adequacy of public services that promote market competition, thus assessing
    the de facto provision of services that create an equal level of playing field
    in markets, and that foster and promote innovation.

    and gas industries. Value added is the contribution to the economy by a producer
    or an industry or an institutional sector, which is estimated by the total value
    of output produced and deducting the total value of intermediate consumption of
    goods and services used to produce that output. The core indicator has been divided
    by the number of workers in the economy to derive a measure of labor productivity.
    This indicator is expressed in constant prices, meaning the series has been adjusted
    to account for price changes over time. The reference year for this adjustment
    is 2015. This indicator is expressed in United States dollars.

    in diameter (PM2.5), ambient ozone pollution, and indoor concentrations of PM2.5
    in households cooking with solid fuels. Damages are calculated as foregone labor
    income due to premature death. Estimates of health impacts from the Global Burden
    of Disease Study 2013 are for 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2013. Data for
    other years have been extrapolated from trends in mortality rates. This indicator

    lifetime (capped at 25 years). It covers coal, crude oil, and natural gas. Mineral
    depletion is the ratio of the value of the stock of mineral resources to the remaining

    the number of visitors, which includes tourists, same-day visitors, cruise passengers,
    and crew members, is shown instead. Sources and collection methods for arrivals
    differ across countries. In some cases data are from border statistics (police,
    immigration, and the like) and supplemented by border surveys. In other cases
    data are from tourism accommodation establishments. For some countries number
    of arrivals is limited to arrivals by air and for others to arrivals staying in

    do not. Caution should thus be used in comparing arrivals across countries. The

- description: 'The Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) are a research dataset summarizing
    the views on the quality of governance provided by a large number of enterprise,
    citizen and expert survey respondents in industrial and developing countries.
    Governance consists of the traditions and institutions by which authority in a
    country is exercised. This includes the process by which governments are selected,
    monitored and replaced; the capacity of the government to effectively formulate
    and implement sound policies; and the respect of citizens and the state for the
    institutions that govern economic and social interactions among them. The WGI
    measures six dimensions of governance: Voice and Accountability, Political Stability
    and Absence of Violence/Terrorism, Government Effectiveness, Regulatory Quality,
    Rule of Law, and Control of Corruption. Voice and Accountability captures perceptions
    of the extent to which a country''s citizens are able to participate in selecting
    their government, as well as freedom of expression, freedom of association, and
    a free media. Estimate gives the country''s score on the aggregate indicator,
    in units of a standard normal distribution, i.e. ranging from approximately -2.5
    to 2.5. For each dimension of governance the following information is available
    in the database: estimate, percentile rank, lower bound of 90% confidence interval,
    upper bound of 90% confidence interval, standard error, number of sources.'

    capturing the views and experiences of survey respondents and experts in the public
    and private sectors, as well as various NGOs. These data sources include: (a)
    surveys of households and firms (e.g. Afrobarometer surveys, Gallup World Poll,
    and Global Competitiveness Report survey), (b) NGOs (e.g. Global Integrity, Freedom
    House, Reporters Without Borders), (c) commercial business information providers
    (e.g. Economist Intelligence Unit, S&P Global, Political Risk Services), and (d)
    public sector organizations (e.g. CPIA assessments of World Bank and regional

- description: Battle-related deaths are deaths in battle-related conflicts between
    warring parties in the conflict dyad (two conflict units that are parties to a
    conflict). Typically, battle-related deaths occur in warfare involving the armed
    forces of the warring parties. This includes traditional battlefield fighting,
    guerrilla activities, and all kinds of bombardments of military units, cities,
    and villages, etc. The targets are usually the military itself and its installations
    or state institutions and state representatives, but there is often substantial
    collateral damage in the form of civilians being killed in crossfire, in indiscriminate
    bombings, etc. All deaths--military as well as civilian--incurred in such situations,
    are counted as battle-related deaths.
