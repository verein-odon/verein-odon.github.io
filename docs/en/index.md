We are an association that specializes in the processing and use of [Open Data](/en/open-data). Our goal is to make this data **accessible** and **usable** to foster **innovation**, **transparency**, and **knowledge** in our community.

## What We Do

- **For Organizations and Companies**: We develop [technical solutions](/en/solutions/) to make Open Data usable and assist with every step, from the initial idea and software development to storytelling!

- **For Members and the Data Community**: We offer a platform within the [association](/en/association/) where data enthusiasts, developers, researchers, and decision-makers can network and collaborate on projects that leverage the full potential of Open Data.

- **For the Data Hungry**: We provide [APIs](/en/apis/) for various Open Data.
