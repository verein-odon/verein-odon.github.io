“Open Data is data that can be freely used, processed, modified, and shared by anyone.”

This is the concise definition of Open Data. However, there is more behind the term. Some other important characteristics of Open Data include:

- **Machine-Readability**

Open Data should be provided in formats that can be easily read and processed by computers. This facilitates the analysis and integration of the data into a wide variety of applications.

- **Transparency**

The publication of Open Data promotes transparency, especially when it concerns public administration data. This strengthens public trust and allows for better traceability of decisions.

- **Licensing**

Open Data is published under an open license that allows its use, redistribution, and modification. Well-known open data licenses include, for example, Creative Commons licenses (e.g., CC BY, CC0), which enable unrestricted use and further processing.

- **Value Creation**

Open Data offers potential for innovation and the development of new applications, services, or business models. Companies can use it to improve services, make processes more efficient, or tap into new markets.
